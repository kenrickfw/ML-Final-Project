# AI For Snake Game using DQN

---

## Overview

This project employs Deep Q-Network (DQN) to develop an AI capable of plaing the classic Snake game. The AI learns to play the game by maximizing its score through reinforcement learning. The project includes a custom implementation of the Rainbow DQN algorithm, prioritized experience replay, and a dueling noisy neural network.
